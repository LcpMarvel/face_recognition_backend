# Summary
This is a lite and fast facial analyze SDK can be used in face recognition application. Â 

# Description
As a facial recognition services, it includes some facial analyze process such as face detect, face search and face comparison. face_recoginition_backend, which is running on a backend server, collects the face samples upload from user, manage it in the face dataset. face_recoginition_frontend, which is running on a client such as andorid and ios, detects and verifies the faces from its live camera.
